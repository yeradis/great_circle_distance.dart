# Great Circle Distance [![Pub][pub_version]](../../) ![Travis status][travis_status] [![Coverage Status][coverage_status]][coverage_page]

**Updated to work with Flutter 1.9 and Dart 2.5**

Calculate the great-circle distance between two points (having Latitude,Longitude) on the surface of Earth 
You can get the distance using the Spherical law of cosines, Haversine formula or Vincenty`s formula  

The [great-circle distance][3] is the shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere

Included in this library:

- Spherical law of cosines 
- Haversine formula 
- Vincenty` formula (por from the Android implementation)

`Disclaimer`: The earth is not quite a sphere. This means that errors([0.3%][1],[0.5%][2] errors) from assuming spherical geometry might be considerable depending on the points; so: `don't trust your life on this value`

Usage example:

```dart
final lat1 = 41.139129;
final lon1 = 1.402244;

final lat2 = 41.139074;
final lon2 = 1.402315;

var gcd = new GreatCircleDistance.fromDegrees(latitude1: lat1, longitude1: lon1, latitude2: lat2, longitude2: lon2);

print('Distance from location 1 to 2 using the Haversine formula is: ${gcd.haversineDistance()}');
print('Distance from location 1 to 2 using the Spherical Law of Cosines is: ${gcd.sphericalLawOfCosinesDistance()}');
print('Distance from location 1 to 2 using the Vicenty`s formula is: ${gcd.vincentyDistance()}');
```
